# j8cm_documentation

The original documentation for the j8cm was written in an old version of Microsoft Word.  They are in a format that is no longer supported.  Diagrams were created with Corel software.  This repo is for the updating of the j8cm emulator, assembly language compiler, tutorial, and other related documents.  My intent is to port the documents to the open document format.
